    "\n",
    "A **confidence interval (CI)** is a range of values, derived from sample data, that is likely to contain the population parameter (such as the mean) with a certain level of confidence. For example, a 95% confidence interval suggests that if we were to take 100 different samples and compute a confidence interval for each, approximately 95 of the intervals would contain the population parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Components:\n",
    "1. **Point estimate**: A single value estimate of a population parameter (e.g., sample mean).\n",
    "2. **Margin of error**: A value that quantifies the uncertainty in the point estimate, which depends on the variability in the data and the sample size.\n",
    "3. **Confidence level**: The percentage that reflects how confident we are that the interval contains the population parameter (common values are 90%, 95%, and 99%).\n",

    "For a population mean (\\( \\mu \\)), when the sample mean (\\( \\bar{x} \\)) and sample standard deviation (\\( s \\)) are known:\n",

    "### What is the Margin of Error (MOE)?\n",
    "\n",
    "The **margin of error** in a confidence interval is the range above and below the point estimate (e.g., sample mean) that defines the width of the confidence interval. It reflects the amount of uncertainty around the point estimate and quantifies how much the estimate could vary if we took different samples from the population.\n",
    "\n",
    "The formula for margin of error in the case of a population mean is:\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "\\text{MOE} = Z \\times \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{n}}\n",

    "Where:\n",
    "- \\( Z \\): The Z-score associated with the desired confidence level (e.g., 1.96 for 95% confidence).\n",
    "- \\( s \\): The sample standard deviation.\n",
    "- \\( n \\): The sample size.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How Does Sample Size Affect the Margin of Error?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Larger sample size** (\\( n \\)): Decreases the standard error (\\( \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{n}} \\)), thus reducing the margin of error. This results in a narrower confidence interval, meaning we have a more precise estimate of the population parameter.\n",
    "- **Smaller sample size** (\\( n \\)): Increases the standard error, making the margin of error larger. This leads to a wider confidence interval, indicating more uncertainty in the estimate.\n",
    "\n",
    "The margin of error is inversely proportional to the square root of the sample size. As sample size increases, the margin of error decreases, but at a diminishing rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we are estimating the average weight of apples in a store. The mean weight of apples from a small sample is 150 grams, with a standard deviation of 10 grams, and we want to construct a 95% confidence interval.\n",

    "\n",
    "- Sample size (\\( n = 25 \\))\n",

    "\n",
    "So, the confidence interval is \\( 150 \\pm 3.92 \\), which gives \\( [146.08, 153.92] \\).\n",

    "#### Scenario 2: Larger Sample Size\n",
    "\n",
    "- Sample size (\\( n = 100 \\))\n",
    "- Standard error \\( SE = \\frac{10}{\\sqrt{100}} = 1 \\)\n",
    "- Margin of error \\( \\text{MOE} = 1.96 \\times 1 = 1.96 \\)\n",
    "\n",
    "With a larger sample, the confidence interval is \\( 150 \\pm 1.96 \\), which gives \\( [148.04, 151.96] \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interpretation:\n",
    "\n",
    "With a larger sample size, the margin of error shrinks, and the confidence interval becomes narrower. In the second scenario, the estimate of the average weight of apples is more precise (i.e., there's less uncertainty), because the larger sample size reduces variability and increases confidence in the estimate."

    "- **Alternative hypothesis (\\( H_a \\))**: Caffeine significantly reduces reaction time, i.e., the mean reaction time is less than the typical mean.\n",

    "\n",
    "This is a **one-tailed t-test** because we’re testing if caffeine **reduces** reaction time.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 2: Gather Information\n",
    "- Sample mean (\\( \\bar{x} \\)) = 0.25 seconds\n",
    "- Population mean (\\( \\mu_0 \\)) = 0.3 seconds\n",

    "#### Step 4: Determine the Critical Value\n",
    "For a **one-tailed t-test** at the 90% confidence level, with \\( n - 1 = 30 - 1 = 29 \\) degrees of freedom, the critical t-value is approximately **-1.311** (from the t-distribution table).\n",

    "#### Step 5: Compare the Test Statistic to the Critical Value\n",
    "- **Test statistic (t) = -5.48**\n",
    "- **Critical value = -1.311**\n",
    "\n",
    "Since \\( t = -5.48 \\) is much smaller (more negative) than the critical value of \\( -1.311 \\), we **reject the null hypothesis**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 6: Conclusion\n",
    "At the 90% confidence level, we reject the null hypothesis. This means there is strong evidence to suggest that caffeine has a significant effect on reducing reaction time. The sample mean of 0.25 seconds is significantly lower than the assumed population mean of 0.3 seconds.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interpretation:\n",
    "Based on the results of the t-test, we conclude that caffeine significantly reduces reaction time, with a 90% confidence level. The evidence supports the idea that caffeine improves reaction speed."
